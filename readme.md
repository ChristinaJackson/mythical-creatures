# Mythical Creatures

![Mythical Creatures](https://storage.needpix.com/rsynced_images/dragon-face-1506961042BLW.jpg)

Welcome Adventurer. This project is modeled after a project done by Zero-to-Mastery during the 2019 Hacktoberfest. I learned a lot during the process and I wanted to pass the experience on to my fellow codecademy learners. It is is designed to utilize HTML, CSS & vanilla JavaScript to achieve a simplistic yet fantastic guide to mythical creatures and beasts.

This is a practice project for fun and should be considered a playground. We have lots of options for contributing, here are a few of the many pull requests that we welcome:

- HTML elements
- CSS styling
- Images
- Text/Copy
- Documentation
- Fix Typos, Code Bugs or Accessibility oversights

## Project Brief
This will be a guide and one stop shop for all Adventurers who may encounter any number of mythical creatures like bigfoot, dragons, cthulhu, or any local legends from your area. 

The website should provide visitors with the following:

- [ ] A picture guide to the different types of creatures, good and bad
- [ ] Information about them, for example: What is their habitat, where to find them, strengths and weaknesses etc 
- [ ] Starring in: tv/movies that include mythical monsters ðŸŽ¥
- [ ] Shopping page for gear needed to battle monsters
- [ ] Mythical Creature Books ðŸ“š
- [ ] Mythical Creature party costumes
- [ ] Themed backgrounds
- [ ] Hero [name generator webapp](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=hero+name+generator) ðŸ“±
- [ ] Any other section you may see fit
